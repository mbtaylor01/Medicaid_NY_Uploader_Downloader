# ‚ÜïÔ∏è Medicaid of NY Uploader/Downloader

Medicaid of NY is one of the few Medicaids that does not have an SFTP option to upload claim batches and download reports - someone has to log into their website and do it manually.  

Using Selenium with Chrome, this script automates the login process and will automatically upload files beginning with the characters you specify in the mdny_settings.txt file.

Any errors are reported with the Yagmail library linked to a Gmail account.

## ‚öôÔ∏è mdny_settings.txt

## üö® Important! üö® Chromedriver Must Match Browser Version!

Selenium uses a Chromedriver program to control Google Chrome.  The Chromedriver must match the version of the browser.  

Chromedriver versions can be found here:  https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
